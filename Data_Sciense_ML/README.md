# Roadmap: Data Scientists and Machine Learning - Sentiment Prediction for BTC

This roadmap outlines the key steps involved in sentiment prediction for Bitcoin (BTC) using data provided by Data Engineers. The objective is to build highly reliable sentiment prediction models, including linear regression models, and introduce a novel model to enhance the project's value. The roadmap also includes the use of data visualizations to analyze BTC sentiment over time, incorporating graphs to visualize sentiment, predictions, and influential tweets categorized as positive, negative, or neutral. The results will be presented publicly, shared with Data Engineers and Analysts, and used as input for the creation of a frontend interface and an API for client consumption. The roadmap is as follows:

- [ ] **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**
  - [ ] Obtain the preprocessed and normalized BTC sentiment dataset from Data Engineers.
  - [ ] Collaborate with Data Analysts to ensure the dataset meets the requirements for sentiment prediction models.
  - [ ] Conduct any additional data preprocessing steps necessary for model training and evaluation.

- [ ] **Model Selection and Development**
  - [ ] Research and identify suitable sentiment prediction models, such as linear regression, LSTM, or transformer-based models.
  - [ ] Select the most appropriate model based on performance metrics and requirements.
  - [ ] Implement and train the selected model using the preprocessed BTC sentiment dataset.
  - [ ] Optimize the model hyperparameters to improve performance and generalization.

- [ ] **Novel Sentiment Prediction Model**
  - [ ] Explore innovative approaches for sentiment prediction specific to BTC sentiment analysis.
  - [ ] Develop a novel sentiment prediction model tailored to capture unique characteristics of BTC sentiment.
  - [ ] Train and evaluate the novel model using the preprocessed BTC sentiment dataset.
  - [ ] Compare the performance of the novel model with existing models to assess its added value.

- [ ] **Visualization and Graph Analysis**
  - [ ] Utilize data visualizations to analyze BTC sentiment over different time scales.
  - [ ] Create graphs to visualize the sentiment, predictions, and influential tweets categorized as positive, negative, or neutral.
  - [ ] Analyze the relationships and patterns between BTC sentiment, tweet volume, and influential users.
  - [ ] Incorporate interactive features and filters in the visualizations for enhanced exploration.

- [ ] **Results Presentation and Public Exposure**
  - [ ] Prepare a comprehensive presentation summarizing the sentiment prediction results.
  - [ ] Share the findings with Data Engineers, Analysts, and stakeholders, highlighting the performance of the models.
  - [ ] Conduct a public presentation to showcase the sentiment prediction capabilities and insights.
  - [ ] Address questions and provide explanations regarding the prediction models and their implications.

- [ ] **Frontend Development and API Creation**
  - [ ] Collaborate with Data Engineers to integrate the sentiment prediction models into the frontend interface.
  - [ ] Design and develop an interactive frontend interface for users to access and explore the sentiment predictions.
  - [ ] Create an API to enable clients to consume the sentiment prediction results programmatically.
